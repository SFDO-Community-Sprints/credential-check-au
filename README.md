# credential-check-au

Continuing the work of a team at the February 2024 Sprint, this team expanded the original goal of managing security and information checks for multiple people and matching qualifications to roles.

Work performed at this sprint:

Review of Feb 2024 Sydney Sprint, including a very detailed process map done in the Lucid Chart.
Discussion to expand the scope of the project beyond working with Children, to fit broader use cases and general credential checks, including a credential verification process with data points for credential management.
Built out data model and permission set structure.
